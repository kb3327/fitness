            Personal training offers a focused, customized approach to fitness. 
            Whether you're starting your fitness journey or pushing toward advanced goals,
             personal trainers provide structure, motivation, and results-driven programming.
             Personal training is more than just working outâ€”it's about unlocking your 
             potential with expert guidance and a tailored plan that fits your body, goals,
              and lifestyle. Unlike generic routines, personal training is based on science 
              and strategy, helping you get results faster and more safely. A certified trainer
               evaluates your fitness level, identifies strengths and weaknesses, and creates a 
               plan that grows with you.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            A personalized training plan takes into account your body type, goals,
             schedule, and fitness level. Your trainer adjusts your workouts as you
              progress, helping you avoid plateaus and stay challenged safely.
               Whether you're trying to lose weight, build muscle,
                improve endurance, or recover from an injury, a personal trainer ensures you're
                 doing the right exercises the right way. This one-on-one attention not only builds
                  your physical strength but also keeps you motivated and accountable. In a world full 
                  of fitness fads, personal training offers structure, progress tracking, and real support 
                  every step of the way.
