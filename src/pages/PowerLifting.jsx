          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Power lifting is a discipline focused on maximizing strength through three core lifts:
            squat, bench press, and deadlift. This training style builds raw power, muscle density,
            and mental toughness. Ideal for athletes and fitness enthusiasts aiming to push their limits,
            power lifting requires precision technique and a structured program designed for progressive overload.
            With professional coaching, lifters improve form, avoid injuries, and break through strength plateaus
            in a safe, sustainable way.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Personalized power lifting plans are tailored to your current strength level, mobility, and goals.
            Whether you're preparing for competition or just want to get stronger, each workout is built around
            proper technique, rest periods, and progressive intensity. A coach monitors your progress, adjusts your
            plan, and ensures you're performing at your best. With the right support system, power lifting not only
            transforms your physique but also builds confidence, discipline, and mental resilience.
